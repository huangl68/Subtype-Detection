    "## General Presentation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the presentation is to effectively communicate your findings to a non-technical, but educated, audience (e.g., scientists, physicians, health care executives, company managers, etc.). This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t include technical details, but you should aim to communicate the findings to an audience without a background in statistics, math, or computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to remind us about the project, but only tell us what we really need to know. We are curious about the results, and how you present the results, but they are not the only purpose of this presentation. So, what should you include? Examples, of questions to consider as you prepare your presentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "What problem did your group set out to solve?\n",
    "How did you group define the problem?\n",
    "What do your results mean in practice? Do your results suggest something should change or not change?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your presentation will be graded using the [presentation rubric.](https://jsc370.github.io/assignment_rubrics.html#presentation_rubric)\n",
    "\n",
    "Presentation slides should be uploaded to Quercus by Feb. 11, 18:00.\n",

    "# Written Report Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "The written report should be done using a Jupyter Notebook or RMarkdown document so that it's reproducible (i.e., we should be able to run the `.ipynb` or `.Rmd` file to reproduce the report). The written report should be at most five pages. This means that you will have to be selective in what you choose to report, and which plots you choose to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Answers to Some Common Questions about the Written Report\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not necessary for R/Python code chunks to appear in the report (in R Markdown use the chunk options `echo=FALSE`, `warning = FALSE`, `message = FALSE` and in Jupyter use the command line tool `nbconvert` <sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id = \"ref1\">1</a></sup>) unless there is some part of the code that will contribute to describing what you have done in the data analysis. For example, don’t submit a report with warning messages from a library you loaded in your report. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you will be submitting your R Markdown/Jupyter Notebook file so we can see all the gory details. This leads to …\n",
    "\n",
    "What should be in the report? A high level description of what you have done. This leads to …\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is the intended audience for the report and what do you mean by a “high level description”? The intended audience is an educated person that has taken at least one basic statistics course, but might be a bit rusty on the details. For example, your supervisor at work completed an MBA ten years ago and took a few statistics courses, but the details are a bit hazy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How will my writing be evaluated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your writing will be evaluated for clarity and conciseness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title [1-5]:** There should be an appropriate title, adequate summary, and complete information including names and dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction [1-5]:** The purpose of the research should be clearly stated and the scope of what is considered in the report should be clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods [1-5]:** The role of each method should be clearly stated. The description of the analyses should be clear and unambiguous so that another statistician or data scientist could easily re-construct it. The methods should be described accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results [1-5]:** There should be appropriate tables and graphs. The results should be clearly stated in the context of the problem. The size and direction of significant results should be given. The results must be accurately stated. The research question should be adequately answered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion / Discussion [1-5]:** The results should be clearly and completely summarized. This section should also include discussion of limitations and/or concerns and/or suggestions for future consideration as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Considerations [1-5]:** The ideas should be presented in logical order, with well-organized sections, no grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors, an appropriate level of technical detail, and be clear and easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How will my data analysis and programming be evaluated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis and programming will be evaluated according to the [data analysis](https://jsc370.github.io/assignment_rubrics.html#data_analysis_rubric) and [programming](https://jsc370.github.io/assignment_rubrics.html#programming_rubric) rubrics.\n",
